*Multiscale Climate Dynamics* · *Physics-Informed Machine Learning* · *Climate Sensitivity & Resilience*

I am a climate scientist studying how moist convection and small-scale processes interact with large-scale environment.
My research integrates theory, field observation, high-resolution modeling, climate modeling, and physics-informed 
machine learning to improve the fidelity of Earth system models.

My long-term vision is to lead an interdisciplinary program that connects small-scale
convective physics to global climate risks and societal resilience.
