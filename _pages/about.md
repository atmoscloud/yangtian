*Cloud-Environment Interaction* · *Extremes & Resilience* · *Physics-Informed Machine Learning* 

I am a climate scientist studying the feedbacks between moist convection and the large-scale environment. I integrate theory, field observation, high-resolution modeling, climate modeling, and physics-informed machine learning to improve the fidelity of Earth system models.

My vision is to lead an interdisciplinary program that connects small-scale
convective physics to global climate risks and societal resilience.
