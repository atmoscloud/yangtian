*Multiscale Climate Dynamics* · *Physics-Informed Machine Learning* · *Climate Sensitivity & Resilience*
I am a climate scientist studying how moist convection and small-scale processes 
shape climate sensitivity, extremes, and Earth system resilience. My research 
integrates high-resolution modeling, climate modeling, field observations, 
and physics-informed machine learning to improve the fidelity of Earth system models.
