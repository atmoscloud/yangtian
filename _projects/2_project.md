We use Large Eddy Simulations (LES) CM1 to simulate clouds, compared our simulated cloud to observations, and use this validated cloud field as our "vitual" laboratory to experiment with, aiming at discovering mechanisms behind cloud-aerosol-precipitation coupling.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
