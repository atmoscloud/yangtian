A variational autoencoder (VAE) approach is used to correct the precipitation bias in climate models, providing a post-processing tool for better precipitation predcition.

Based on the LES simulations and observation libraries that we built in the past, a new machine learning project is using these as training datasets to learn convective properties such as mass flux and entrainment rate.
