### Cold pool dynamics

By releasing Lagrangian particles into the simulated cloud field, we explictly track the life cycle of cold pool, and diagnose the relative contribution from dynamic and thermodynamic factors.

### Updraft momentum

Explain role of density currents, gust fronts, secondary initiation, and timing.

### Convective sensitivity

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
